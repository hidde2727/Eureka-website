## The Eureka site 
#### Made by Hidde Meiburg 

To run this site you only need a server capabel of running php and a mysql database

To connect this database create a file called 'ConnectionData.php' in the MySQL folder with this content:

```PHP
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$database = "databaseName";
?>
```

To setup the server visit www.domainName.xxx/MySQL/Setup.php
